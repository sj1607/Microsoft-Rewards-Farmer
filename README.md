## Important Instructions 📝

- **Token Setup**: You must place your Discord bot token in the `config.json` file for the bot to work. 🔑
- **Security Notice**: 
  - The email and password will be stored in plaintext when executing commands. Therefore, it is highly discouraged to use this bot on a public server. 🚫
  - Additionally, make sure that 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) is disabled on your Microsoft account to prevent issues. 🔒

## Security Considerations ⚠️

- For your safety, I will not provide a direct `.exe` release. ❌
- If anyone offers this service on Discord, I strongly advise against using it. 🚷
- **Use this bot only on your private server.** 🔒
- After using the command, remember to delete the message containing the command for added security. 🗑️
- Regularly change your Microsoft account passwords to ensure the safety of your account. 🔄

Stay safe and enjoy farming your Microsoft Rewards! 😊
